/**
 * Finds the minimum-length substring (window) in a source string that contains
 * all characters of a target string with their required frequencies.
 *
 * <p>Purpose: This class implements the classic "minimum window substring"
 * problem using the sliding-window technique. It demonstrates how to
 * maintain character frequency counts for the current window and for the
 * required target, expand the window to include required characters, and
 * then contract it to find the smallest valid window.</p>
 *
 * <p>Complexity:
 * - Time: O(n + m) â‰ˆ O(n) where n = length of source string and m = length
 *   of target string. Each character in the source is added and removed
 *   from the window at most once.
 * - Space: O(k) where k is the number of distinct characters in the
 *   target (for the target frequency map) plus the distinct characters
 *   seen in the current window (window frequency map).</p>
